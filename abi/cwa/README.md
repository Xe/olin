# Common WebAssembly API Compliance

This ABI complies to the spec outlined in the [GitHub repo CommonWA/cwa-spec](https://github.com/CommonWA/cwa-spec). The vendored copy of the CWA spec will reflect what Olin implements.

There are no tests for CWA compliance, so some will be developed as part of this.
