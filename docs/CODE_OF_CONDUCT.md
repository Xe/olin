# Code of Conduct

We are Human.  
To be Human is to be limited.  
In our limitation, we make choices that are unwise or are flawed.

If we make unwise choices because of our limitation,  
we cannot judge others for the same reason.

So, we cannot judge,  
thus we forgive. 

This project and its results are intended as:  
a place of learning,  
a place of understanding,  
a place of teaching,  
a place of sharing,  
a place of creators creating the tools for other creators to create complicated things elegantly.

Be well, Creator. Be well and create.

The Olin project is not interested in policing the behavior of users that participate in it.
Please do not act in a way that would merit such policing. Use common sense. If you cannot
trust yourself to use common sense, you may have limited enjoyment of this community space.

This document is meant in good faith and the beginning is phrased as a blessing for all who
participate in this community in any form.

Assume good faith, we just want to create stable and understandable software.
