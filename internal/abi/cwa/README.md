# Common WebAssembly API Compliance

This ABI complies to the spec outlined in the [GitHub repo CommonWA/cwa-spec](https://github.com/CommonWA/cwa-spec) as of this commit: https://github.com/CommonWA/cwa-spec/commit/749e805766adfbd88fb9061d11a9feec90711437.

There are no tests for CWA compliance, so some will be developed as part of this.
